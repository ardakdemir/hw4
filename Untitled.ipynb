    "    For this matrix which is very similar to part a we need both left and right multiplication. Left multiplication to put zeros on the lower half and on the middle. Then right multiplication for upper right corner. So (ii) is true for b.\n",

    "    This matrix is singular. We can not obtain a singular matrix by multiplying a matrix with non-singular matrices. Thus, for part c (iii) holds."
